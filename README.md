# Game of Thrones Text Analysis

show across episodes or seasons in analysis 1. We can also input a word and analysis 2 gives
a word trend analysis across episodes or seasons.

This app was created using R and the package shiny, as well as the afinn sentiment lexicon. I
used tidyverse for data manipulation and graphics, tidytext for text mining, plotly for
web-interactive graphics, and DT to work with HTML table widgets. 

This code is refactored and developed further on from a class project I did in Concepts in 
Computing with Data.
